This repository is part of a lecture series on compiler construction at the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University Karlsruhe. The university offers career-integrated undergraduate study programs. In alternating three-month phases, students learn theory at the university and receive practical training from an enterprise.

Jasmine is a small extension of the Java Assembler Interface (Jasmin) for more convenient use in compilers. It contains classes that automatically generate the typical Jasmin file format based on the supplied method parameters. Thus, the developer does not have to deal with the syntax.
